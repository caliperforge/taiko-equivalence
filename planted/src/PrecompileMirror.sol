///
/// Type-1 Ethereum-equivalence requires that the rollup execution client
/// return byte-identical output to L1 for every precompile invocation on
/// every input. This repository does NOT vendor Taiko's execution client. The
/// mirror is the smallest contract that exposes the precompile surface
/// the way an application sees it: input bytes in, output bytes out.
///
/// Twin shape: the CLEAN mirror is a direct passthrough to the canonical
/// L1 precompile address. The PLANTED twin (under `planted/`) introduces a
/// localized divergence - the same single-hunk discipline used for every
/// planted twin in this repository - which the differential harness in `test/` detects as
/// "the mirror disagrees with L1."
///
/// Precompile chosen: SHA256 (`0x02`). SHA256 is the simplest to vector-test
/// (RFC 6234 / NIST FIPS 180-4 test vectors are public and one-shot), and
/// SHA256 equivalence is implied verbatim by Type-1 - a rollup that drifts
/// on SHA256 cannot run L1's pre-compiled cryptography stack at all.
