/// Type-1 Ethereum-equivalence requires that the rollup charge L1's exact
/// gas costs for every opcode. This repository models the gas schedule as an
/// in-Solidity bookkeeping contract rather than executing real opcodes  -
/// real opcode costs would be the *Foundry VM's* costs, which are already
/// L1-equivalent; the bug class we want to catch is the *execution-client
/// shim* that quietly reuses a stale gas constant (EIP-2929, EIP-3529,
/// EIP-3651) or invents a "Taiko-cheaper" constant. The shim is a contract;
/// the contract is what the mirror models.
///
/// Specific cost we track: EIP-2929 cold-vs-warm SLOAD. Cold = 2100 gas
/// (EIP-2929 §"Specification": COLD_SLOAD_COST), warm = 100 gas
/// (WARM_STORAGE_READ_COST). A single deviation on either constant is a
/// Type-1 break.
///
/// Twin shape: CLEAN mirror returns the L1 constants verbatim. PLANTED twin
/// returns a constant that is off by the canonical EIP-2929 vs EIP-2200
/// regression (the cold-read used to be 800 under EIP-2200; the EIP-2929
/// uplift is the bug class an execution-client shim is most likely to miss).
