/// @title BasedSequencer (CLEAN twin) - Taiko based-sequencing ordering mirror.
///
/// Taiko's based-sequencing rule: L2 blocks land in proposal order. The
/// proposer is whoever included the L2 block on L1 first, and the prover
/// (separate role) does NOT reorder. This is the bedrock guarantee that
/// distinguishes a based rollup from a "rollup-with-sequencer-MEV-extraction"
/// design - a proposer or prover that quietly sorts the block by priority
/// fee descending IS a Taiko spec violation.
///
/// This repository does NOT model the on-chain proposer auction or the
/// prover market. The mirror exposes the ONE invariant that downstream apps rely
/// on: the order an inclusion list is finalized in IS the order proposals
/// arrived. Any contract that exposes a `propose -> finalize` shape and
/// claims based-sequencing semantics MUST hold this invariant.
///
/// Twin shape: CLEAN mirror appends to the inclusion list in insertion
/// order. PLANTED twin sorts the list by priority fee descending at
/// `finalize()` time - the canonical "sequencer reorder for MEV" bug
/// class which based-sequencing is supposed to make impossible.
///
/// Reference: Taiko whitepaper §"Based contestable rollup", §"Proposing
/// and proving". Cited in README.
